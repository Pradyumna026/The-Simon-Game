# The-Simon-Game

The Simon game project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is an interactive web application that recreates the classic memory game. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic, it features four colored buttons that light up in a random sequence. The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequences become more complex, testing the player's memory. This project is an excellent way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic in JavaScript.
